If you are reading this, then you are (hopefully) part of the Art Department and (also hopefully) not here to just watch youtube videos and listen to music. I'm going to have a READ_ME up in a bit - Xam5698

Ahoy, If you're reading this, You're either apart of the Art team in alvey world or the NSA. Either way, WELCOME.  Our job in this art team is to create all off the visual assets in the game (i.e. backgrounds, characters, enemies, etc.) So, if you hadn't heard, I'm Deyge, Head of the art team for some odd reason(It's because of the beanie).  Basically we're trying to capture the feel of a retro game.  So everything we're going to be creating is going to be in a very bit crushed status.  When you feel like getting started, talk to me or Josh Beitler to see what you need to work on - Deyge (Grand Poobah of the Art Department)
