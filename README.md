# Super Alveyworld
> This multi-class project will help demonstrate object oriented programming, working in teams, collaborating, and hopefully be a lot of fun.  The game is based off of the _wonderous_ [Pygame starter kit](https://github.com/alveyworld-dev/starterkit).

## Getting Started
This game is developed with 4 primary teams.
* Coding
* Art
* Music
* Testing

Each team has a specific purpose, team leader, and members who are best in that area.  Different teams have different needs, and as such will approach modifying the game in different ways.

Not sure what team you're on?  Ask someone who knows, or [check here](https://github.com/alveyworld-dev/game/wiki/Team-Roster)

Codemonkeys, you will want to glance at the [Code Team README](https://github.com/alveyworld-dev/game/blob/master/CODING.md).  You should probably also get familiar with the starter kit, and get some tasks assigned to you!

### Art

[Read this.](https://github.com/alveyworld-dev/game/blob/master/ART.md) Your job is to create sprites, backgrounds, and level designs for the game.  If you don't think you are very good with drawing, you might consider level design or concepts.

### Music

[Here's your README](https://github.com/alveyworld-dev/game/blob/master/MUSIC.md) - read it and read it well.  We're going for retro sounding 8-bit music.

- (also be sure to e-mail me (@ xam5698@hotmail.com) your music files to see where it's going along)

### Testing
You have an important job: make sure the darned thing works, and that it works well!  You _must_ read up on the [GitHub issue tracker](https://github.com/alveyworld-dev/game/issues), for it will be your best friend.
