If you are part of the Testing Department: Hello! 
 Game testing is a vital task for finding and fixing bugs; if you are here because you have been kicked from other Departments: You are still doing a very important job, infact it is probably THE MOST important job besides coding. So no slacking off and watching youtube videos. Seriously. I can see everything you do.
 
To document bugs simply do the following: 

- 1: Go onto www.github.com/alveyworld-dev/game

- 2: Click the little ! with a circle around it (it should be called issues)

- 3: Click NEW ISSUE and type out the bug, what line it's on, etc.

- 4: Click one of the little boxes that say either BUG or SEVERE - BUG or whatever

- 5: Submit the bug

- 6: Someone will be notified and try to fix the bug

- 7: Go back and find more bugs you slacker

- 8: If you are still on youtube you will be permanently assigned to Team 5 watch

- 9: If you are not watching Team 5, you will be fed to the laser sharks

(More will be added to the READ_ME later, this is just bug documentation)
