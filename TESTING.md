If you are part of the Testing Department: Hello! 
 Game testing is a vital task for finding and fixing bugs; if you are here because you have been kicked from other Departments: You are still doing a very important job, infact it is probably THE MOST important job besides coding. So no slacking off and watching youtube videos. Seriously. I can see everything you do.
 
To document bugs simply do the following: 
1: Go onto www.github.com/alveyworld-dev/game
2: Click the little ! with a circle around it (it should be called issues)
3: Click NEW ISSUE and type out the bug, what line it's on, etc.
4: Click one of the little boxes that say either BUG or SEVERE - BUG or whatever
5: Submit the bug
6: Someone will be notified and try to fix the bug
7: Go back and find more bugs you slacker

(More will be added to the READ_ME later, this is just bug documentation)
