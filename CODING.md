Being on the coding team is not something to slack off about! Most of us work at home and school, and while we don't expect all to be that dedicated, if you don't do your work, you will become a grade-A tester, tied to a post, and beaten with a fish.

A few things to remember:
* First thing you do in class: sync your version of the repo with the GitHub app, and head to the GitHub website.
* Check all the issues assigned to you
* Meet with team to decide what you are doing today
* Get cracking!

#### Code Documentation
_Document your code_!  This is _very_ important.  A few things to note:

 Use comments to describe code that might be confusing.  _Please_ don't comment things that are self-explanatory.
```python
# Describes the answer to life, the universe, and everything
def 42():
    ....
```
 Document your functions and classes with documentation comments!
```python
def my_func():
    """
    Allows the user to calculate the velocity of an unladen sparrow, be it European or African.
    """

    ...
```

### Initial Tasks
Our task is probably the most complicated of all, though its not nearly as hard as you might think.  Here's a few things to consider as you hack away at that poor, poor starter kit.
* Scrolling backgrounds
* Implementing sprites, moving characters
* Collision detection
* Enemies

### Secondary Tasks
* Powerups
* Multiple weapons
* Multiple screens
* High score system

### Fun Things
These things aren't _that_ important, though they would be fun to tackle once we get the basics down.
* Day/night cycle
* Prettyful animations
* Parallax backgrounds

## FAQ
* Q: What's with the `__init__.py` files?
  * A: Ignore them.  They are simply so that Python can find files in that folder.
* Q: I can't understand _whoever's_ code! 
  * A: Confront them about it, or fix it yourself!
* Q: Josh is so mean!  He makes me work!
  * A: Rome wasn't built by paying the workers wages.
