Tile Codes
(each tile is a 32 square pixel rectangle)

b - block (walk on top)
c - climb (blocks with sticky sides)
e - enemy (decreases power)
t - trap  (timed loss of life, jump to escape)
x - death (instant loss of life, end level)
r - ride (moves if on top)
p - power up (increases power)

** Each level will have its own costumes for each tile, so the
tile codes will all be the same, but they will look different in
each level **
