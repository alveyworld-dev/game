Tile Codes
(each tile is a 32 square pixel rectangle)

B - block (walk on top)
C - climb (blocks with sticky sides)
E - enemy (decreases power)
T - trap  (timed loss of life, jump to escape)
X - death (instant loss of life, end level)
R - ride (moves if on top)
P - power up (increases power)

** Each level will have its own costumes for each tile, so the
tile codes will all be the same, but they will look different in
each level **
