# Music People, harken!

If you are part of the music department, here are the qualifications for sound:
Either you must get onto www.bfxr.net for sound effects (Of which we need DEARLY).
You may also use any music making software of your choice AS LONG AS its files can be saved in the .wav format

Or you can get onto Garage Band to create music, it must follow these qualifications::
  It should be AT LEAST 128 BPM unless you consult me first
  It must be an upbeat sort of style unless you consult me first 
  Next You must have an 8-bit filter (I will post a tutorial to do so later): This is mandatory
  ::

If you'd like to send me the music you are working on email it to me @ xam5698@hotmail.com .
Anyone who slacks off or isn't working will be put into another group or they will be relegated to testing

ALSO, if you'd like to have your music put into the game, PLEASE put it onto github under the resources folder and commit the file.

Remember: I WILL be listening to every song you e-mail/ put onto the resources folder. So do your best, and have fun with your musical talents.
